## Introduction

This pipeline is for assembly, binning, and annotation of metagenomes.
It supports both short and long reads, quality trims the reads and adapters with [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) and [porechop](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop), and performs basic QC with [fastqc](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).

The pipeline then:

* assigns taxonomy to reads using [centrifuge](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/) and/or [kraken2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/)
* performs assembly using [megahit](https://github.com/voutcn/megahit) and [spades](http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/), and checks their quality using [quast](http://quast.sourceforge.net/quast)
* performs metagenome binning using [metabat2](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat/src/master/), and checks the quality of the genome bins using [busco](https://busco.ezlab.org/)

Furthermore, the pipeline creates various reports in the results directory specified, including a [multiqc](https://multiqc.info/) report summarizing some of the findings and software versions.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Quick Start

1. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

2. Install either [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```bash
    nextflow run nf-core/mag -profile test,<docker/singularity/conda/institute>
    ```

    > Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.

4. Start running your own analysis!

    <!-- TODO nf-core: Update the example "typical command" below used to run the pipeline -->

    ```bash
    nextflow run nf-core/mag -profile <docker/singularity/conda/institute> --input '*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz'
    ```

See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.

## Documentation

The nf-core/mag pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline which you can read at [https://nf-core/mag/docs](https://nf-core/mag/docs) or find in the [`docs/` directory](docs).
